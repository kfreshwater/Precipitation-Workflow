# Precipitation-Workflow
This repository builds upon an in-class coding session for Matt Ross's ESS580A9 'Environmental Data Science Applications: Water Resources' course at Colorado State University. The purpose of this analysis was to geographically define airport weather stations across Colorado, then compare daily precipitation data between selected stations over a number of years.   Although all data was downloaded in R, a data folder is present in case of hypothetical additions. Additionally, a src folder is present to provide documentation for previous iterations of the final html page.
